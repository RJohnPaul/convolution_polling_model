# convolution_polling_model

This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using convolutional filters and includes the implementation of a Max Pooling model in Python. The script utilizes popular libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Modules Required

To run this project, you'll need to have the following Python modules installed:

- **OpenCV** - A library for computer vision and image processing.
  - [OpenCV Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/)

- **NumPy** - A library for numerical operations in Python.
  - [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/)

- **SciPy** - A library used for scientific and technical computing.
  - [SciPy Documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/)

- **Matplotlib** - A plotting library for creating visualizations.
  - [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)
